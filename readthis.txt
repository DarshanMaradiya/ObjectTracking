To run on video : python ObjectTracker.py --input videos/car_chase_01.mp4 --confidence 0.5 --threshold 0.3

To run on webcam : python ObjectTracker.py --input camera --confidence 0.5 --threshold 0.3




#note : confidence and threshold are optional arguements
	you need to rename output.avi eveytime after the code finishes the process or gets terminated, else in the next run of the code, the file output.avi will get overwritten.
